## **Start Here**

If you would like to contribute to this project here are some instructions on how to get started.

If you haven't installed git install [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

You can add suggestions, enhancements, report bugs etc by clicking on issues to work on.

### **OPTION 1 USING GIT**

1. **Fork** this repository to get your own copy of the project to work on. To do this press
fork at the top right of this page. This will copy the project over to your own repositories.

2. Download the project to your PC by clicking **Clone or Download**

3. You can now work on the project on your own PC!

4. As you make changes you can use the command _git commit -m "INSERT MESSAGE HERE"_ to save changes.

5. After you finish a task you can send them to your github by using the command _"git push origin master"_

6. Go to my Chess 2.0 page and select _Pull requests_ then _New pull request_ and follow through the steps
and they will be sent to be merged with the main branch.

### **OPTION 2 WITHOUT GIT**

1. If using git is too much just download using Clone or Download to download a zip file of the project.

2. Do some code and then just email me the files and I can add them to the project.

### **Git commands**

Here are the main git commands you need to know. It is a commandline application and you should navigate
to the project repository to use these commands.

- _git init_ -> initializes a git repository
- _git add_ "ENTER FILENAME HERE" -> adds a file to your git project
- _git commit -m_"ENTER MESSAGE HERE" -> save a change to your project along with a short message summarising what you changed.
- _git remote add origin "git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git"_ -> Connects your local project on your PC to the same project at a remote location (e.g. on github).
This allows you to send communicate to the remote and send files back and forth.
- _git pull origin master_ -> pulls the files from the remote repository on github to your local one on your PC.
- _git push origin master_ -> pushes the files from your local repository to the remote one on github.

These are the main ones to get familiar with but there are many more!
